        More flexible, faster check like ``is`` but that works through views.

        Note: this is *not* the same as ``Index.identical()``, which checks
        that metadata is also the same.

        ----------
        other : object
            other object to compare against.

        Returns
        -------
        True if both have same underlying data, False otherwise : bool
