    """

        Parameters
        ----------
        stacklevel : int, default 4
           the level to show of the stack when the error is output
        t : str, the type of setting error
        force : bool, default False
           If True, then force showing an error.

        validate if we are doing a setitem on a chained copy.

        If you call this function, be sure to set the stacklevel such that the
        user will see the error *at the level of setting*

        It is technically possible to figure out that we are setting on
        a copy even WITH a multi-dtyped pandas object. In other words, some
        blocks may be views while other are not. Currently _is_view will ALWAYS
        return False for multi-blocks to avoid having to handle this case.

        df = DataFrame(np.arange(0,9), columns=['count'])
        df['group'] = 'b'

        # This technically need not raise SettingWithCopy if both are view
        # (which is not # generally guaranteed but is usually True.  However,
        # this is in general not a good practice and we recommend using .loc.
        df.iloc[0:5]['group'] = 'a'
