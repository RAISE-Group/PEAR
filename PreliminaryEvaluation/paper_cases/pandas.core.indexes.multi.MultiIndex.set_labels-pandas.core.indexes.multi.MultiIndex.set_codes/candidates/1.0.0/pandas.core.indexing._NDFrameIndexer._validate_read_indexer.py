def _validate_read_indexer(self, key, indexer, axis: int, raise_missing: bool=False):
    """
        Check that indexer can be used to return a result.

        e.g. at least one element was found,
        unless the list of keys was actually empty.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : list-like
            Targeted labels (only used to show correct error message).
        indexer: array-like of booleans
            Indices corresponding to the key,
            (with -1 indicating not found).
        axis: int
            Dimension on which the indexing is being made.
        raise_missing: bool
            Whether to raise a KeyError if some labels are not found. Will be
            removed in the future, and then this method will always behave as
            if raise_missing=True.

        Raises
        ------
        KeyError
            If at least one key was requested but none was found, and
            raise_missing=True.
